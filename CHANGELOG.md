Changelog
=========================

We have two kinds of updates. A major update occurs when y changes in x.y.z. A minor update when z changes.

Major updates can introduce code incompabilities with code that uses a previous version of this library. Minor updates are garantueed to only include bug fixes or upgrades of a few depedencies.
